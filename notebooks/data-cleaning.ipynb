       "'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a 2017 kart racing game developed and published by Nintendo and released for the Nintendo Switch. The game is an expanded and enhanced re-release of the 2014 game Mario Kart 8. Deluxe follows the same gameplay as Mario Kart 8 and the rest of the Mario Kart series, where players race in go-karts while trying to sabotage each other with items. Players can control one of several characters from the Mario franchise and other Nintendo franchises, with several additional characters being added in Deluxe. The game also introduces a revamped battle mode, featuring five sub-modes and eight battle courses.\\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe was first teased in October 2016 during the Nintendo Switch reveal trailer, and was fully revealed during the Nintendo Switch Presentation in January 2017. A later trailer showcased several of the game\\'s features, including the new battle mode. Deluxe released on April 28, 2017, and as of September 2022, it has sold 48.41 million units, making it the best-selling Nintendo Switch game and one of the best-selling games of all time.\\nSince launch, Deluxe has received several software updates. One such update edited a gesture performed by the Inkling Girl that was likened to the bras d\\'honneur, which is considered offensive in certain countries. Additional updates introduced compatibility with the toys-to-life concept Nintendo Labo. In February 2022, Deluxe was announced to be receiving paid downloadable content known as the Booster Course Pass. The Booster Course Pass features 48 additional race courses split into six waves, set to be released by the end of 2023.\\nUpon its release, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe received universal acclaim. Critics widely considered it to be the definitive edition of Mario Kart 8, and some considered it the best game in the Mario Kart series or one of the best racing games of all time. However, some criticized the lack of significant new content compared to the Wii U original.\\n\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\nLike previous entries in the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a kart racing game that sees players controlling characters from the Mario franchise racing in locations inspired by the Mario universe, while trying to sabotage other players with items, with players gaining access to stronger items the further behind first place they are. Also similar to previous Mario Kart games, players can choose to play competitive free-for-all or team-based multiplayer. Up to four players can play together on a single system, up to eight can play together through a local wireless connection, and up to twelve can play together via online multiplayer.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe includes all downloadable content (DLC) released for Mario Kart 8, including characters, courses, and vehicle components. Unlike the original Mario Kart 8, all courses and characters in Deluxe are accessible upon first starting the game, without the need to be unlocked. Deluxe includes 42 characters, with many not needing to be unlocked through gameplay. Similar to Mario Kart 8, Deluxe features several crossover elements from other Nintendo franchises, such as Link from The Legend of Zelda, and the Big Blue and Mute City courses from F-Zero. Several new characters are introduced in Deluxe, including the Inklings from Splatoon, Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, and King Boo. Several vehicle customization options are included in Deluxe. These consist of kart and bike bodies, wheels, and gliders. Combined with the weight class of every character, the stats of each vehicle component determine the player\\'s speed, acceleration, weight, handling, and grip.In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the \"fire-hopping\" glitch was removed, which allowed players to receive a larger boost when drifting in Mario Kart 8. In Deluxe, this is replaced by the ability to get a larger boost by holding the drift button for a longer amount of time, without the need for glitches. An additional change made in Deluxe is that players can hold two items at once, similar to Mario Kart: Double Dash. However, unlike Double Dash, the player can not freely switch between both of their items. Deluxe also reintroduces the Boo item, which steals an item from another player, as well as become invisible for a short amount of time. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe introduced several accessibility features to assist newer players. One such addition is Smart Steering, which automatically prevents players from veering off course when enabled. Another accessibility feature introduced in Deluxe is auto-acceleration, which accelerates the user\\'s vehicle without the need for the button to be held.Deluxe includes 48 courses in the standard racing modes, including the 16 courses that initially released as DLC in Mario Kart 8. However, Deluxe will have 96 courses after all waves of the Booster Course Pass release. The courses in Mario Kart 8 and Deluxe make use of anti-gravity, which allows players to drive on walls and other surfaces, as well as the ability to glide through the air, introduced in Mario Kart 7. Another mechanic that was introduced in Mario Kart 7 and returned in 8 and Deluxe is underwater driving, which allows players to drive in courses than dip into water. In the Booster Course Pass, several courses have differing layouts in every lap, condensing multiple variations of a course into one.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\\'s racing modes include four speed classes: 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and 200cc, with each speed class being considerably faster than the last. Deluxe also includes \"Mirror Mode\", which flips the course layouts by 90 degrees. If players reach first place in all courses in 200cc, they can unlock Gold Mario as an alternate costume for Metal Mario. Players can also participate in Time Trials, which see the player compete a course as fast as possible. Players could play 150cc Time Trials in Mario Kart 8, though the ability to do Time Trials in 200cc was introduced in Deluxe.\\n\\n\\n=== Battle mode ===\\n\\nThe largest addition to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the revamped battle mode. Deluxe includes five new battle mode-exclusive courses, and three battle courses adapted from previous entries in the Mario Kart series. These battle courses are designed specifically for the mode, featuring layouts that allow for easier item play, rather than repurposing standard race courses like Mario Kart 8. The Feather item, reintroduced from previous entries in the series, is exclusive to this mode and allows the player to get a small boost in height when it is activated. The battle mode in Deluxe is composed of five unique sub-modes.Balloon Battle sees players using items to destroy other players\\' balloons. Unlike its previous incarnations, though, the mode is point-based rather than last-man-standing, meaning that the winner is whoever destroys the most balloons before the match ends. If a player loses all of their balloons, they respawn with three balloons rather than five, rather than being eliminated from the match entirely.In Shine Thief, players must maintain control of a Shine Sprite for as long as possible, with the goal to be in control for the longest amount of time, and to avoid the other team stealing it and gaining control. Each player—or team, depending on the mode—has an amount of time that they need to be in control of the Shine Sprite for in order to win.Coin Runners sees players compete to have the most coins in their possession by the end of the match, with players able to find coins in the courses, as well as steal them from other players, as players will drop several coins when hit with an item. The coins scattered around the battle courses are scarce and in a limited supply, meaning that players must actively fight over coins.Bob-omb Blast replaces all items with the Bob-omb item, and players attempt to collect and launch Bob-ombs at their opponents without getting hit themselves. The Bob-ombs in Bob-omb Blast function differently to the Bob-ombs in the rest of the game, as they explode on contact rather than after a short amount of time. The mode otherwise functions similarly to Balloon Battle, with players attempting to gain points by destroying their opponent\\'s balloons.Renegade Roundup involves a team of renegades trying to avoid opponent authorities armed with Piranha Plants, which takes inspiration from the children\\'s game \"cops and robbers\". Captured renegades can be freed by their teammates if a renegade drives over a switch near the prison in which captured renegades are held, though doing so is risky, as the authorities win if all renegades are captured. However, the authorities will lose if at least one renegade is still free when the match ends.\\n\\n\\n== Marketing and release ==\\n\\nOn October 20, 2016, in the initial reveal trailer for the Nintendo Switch, a brief glimpse of a Mario Kart game for the system was shown, though it was unclear at the time whether it would be a new entry in the series or a port of Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U.At the Nintendo Switch Presentation on January 12, 2017, the Mario Kart game shown for the Nintendo Switch was formally revealed as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. It was announced that the game would feature all DLC present in Mario Kart 8, as well as a revamped battle mode. The trailer also showcased crossover elements from the Splatoon series, as well as mechanics such as Smart Steering. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\\'s release date was also set for April 28, 2017. One day after the Nintendo Switch Presentation 2017, Nintendo revealed a steering wheel able to be used for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, used by placing a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controller inside the steering wheel to allow for motion-controlled steering.Nintendo released an overview trailer for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on March 10, 2017, revealing many details about the game\\'s battle mode. The trailer showcased several battle mode-exclusive courses, as well as the return of the Shine Thief mode from Mario Kart: Double Dash. After the release of the trailer, several internet memes circulated surrounding Donkey Kong appearing to perform a celebratory dab.On April 12, 2017, Nintendo\\'s Russian storefront revealed a bundle containing the Nintendo Switch and a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. However, a representative of Nintendo told GameSpot that the company had no plans at the time to release the bundle outside of Russia.\\n\\n\\n=== Sales ===\\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe sold 459,000 copies in the United States on its launch day, making it the fastest-selling entry in the Mario Kart series, ahead of 2008\\'s Mario Kart Wii by 25,000 units. Roughly one year after launch, Deluxe had sold 9.22 million copies. It surpassed Super Mario Odyssey as the best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch in 2019, and Mario Kart Wii as the best-selling Mario Kart game in 2021. Since its release in 2017, Deluxe has been a consistent top-selling game on the Nintendo Switch. As of September 30, 2022, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold 48.41 million units, making it the best-selling Nintendo Switch game, as well as one of the best-selling games of all time.\\n\\n\\n== Updates and downloadable content ==\\nOn May 18, 2017, Nintendo released a software update for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that changed one of the victory gestures done by the Inkling Girl. Prior to the update, the Inkling Girl performed a gesture that consisted of placing her hand on a flexed bicep and pumping her fist into the air. In Japan, the gesture means something similar to \"bring it on!\", though in European and Latin American countries, it was likened to the bras d\\'honneur, an offensive gesture that can be interpreted as \"up your ass\", \"fuck you\", or similar meanings. After the update, the Inkling Girl no longer clenches her fist around her flexed arm, instead simply performing a \"fist pump\", though the rest of the gesture was unchanged. The remainder of the 1.1 update to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe featured minor changes to several mechanics, such as starting positions, invincibility periods, and facial expressions.On June 25, 2018, an update for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe added compatibility with Nintendo Labo, a toys-to-life concept that utilizes cardboard and the technology of the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers. The first update introduced the option to use the Toy-Con Motorbike as a controller in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, allowing the player to control the game using the physical throttle, handlebars, and gyroscope present on the Toy-Con Motorbike, while actions like braking, drifting, and item pickups are still performed using the standard controller buttons. On August 24, 2018, it was announced that the Toy-Con Car, Pedal, and Key would become compatible with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe when they launched on September 14. Using the Toy-Con Car, Pedal, and Key allow the player to control their character using physical controls—including actions like braking and drifting, as well as use the horn on the steering wheel to launch items.On July 20, 2018, an update was released for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that added the Master Cycle Zero, a motorbike present in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\\'s DLC, titled The Champion\\'s Ballad, as well as an outfit for Link in which he wears the Champion\\'s Tunic from that game. Additionally, Breath of the Wild\\'s Paraglider was added as a glider customization option, and the game\\'s Ancient Tires were added as a tire option. The 1.6 update, which added the Breath of the Wild content, also included unlisted changes to \"improve gameplay\".\\n\\n\\n=== Booster Course Pass ===\\n\\nDuring a February 2022 Nintendo Direct, it was announced that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe would get a paid downloadable content season pass called the Booster Course Pass. Courses in the Booster Course Pass are largely remastered from their incarnations in previous Mario Kart games. The Booster Course Pass is set to release in six waves, with each wave containing eight courses split into two cups, totaling to 48 additional tracks to be released by the end of 2023. The first wave of the Booster Course Pass was released on March 22, 2022, containing the Golden Dash Cup and the Lucky Cat Cup. Wave 2 of the Booster Course Pass released on August 4, 2022, containing the Turnip Cup and the Propeller Cup. Wave 2 also included Sky-High Sundae, an original course not introduced in a previous Mario Kart game. Alongside the release of Wave 2, Nintendo released an update to the Wave 1 course Coconut Mall that changed the cars at the end of the course to move in donuts, rather than remain stationary, except for Time Trials. This change was widely praised, especially after many were disappointed that the cars were stationary in the Booster Course Pass to begin with. Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is set to release on December 7, 2022,  containing the Rock Cup and the Moon Cup.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Critical reception ===\\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe received \"universal acclaim\" according to the review aggregate website Metacritic. Many reviewers considered it to be the definitive version of Mario Kart 8, as well as one of the best games in the Mario Kart series or one of the best racing games of all time. Some reviewers also consiered the game to be an essential purchase for Nintendo Switch owners. However, many reviewers criticized the lack of new content in Deluxe compared to Mario Kart 8.The core racing mode present in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was heavily praised. The rubber-banding mechanics present in the game\\'s AI competitors was criticized, though Game Informer noted that \"fans accepted that pitfall as a series mainstay long ago\", and that Deluxe is still \"the same great title from the Wii U\". GameSpot and Nintendo Life also considered Deluxe\\'s core gameplay to be as strong as the original. GamesTM\\'s reviewer appreciated the return of previous DLC, though they disliked the return of the Mercedes-Benz crossover items, saying that their \"blatant and commercial nature\" felt \"at odds\" with the nature of Mario Kart.Deluxe\\'s revamped battle mode received wide acclaim. Easy Allies and Kotaku claimed that the new battle mode far outshined the original game, and Pocket Gamer said that Deluxe returned battle mode to its \"original arena-battling glory\". GamesRadar+ found that the quality present in Deluxe\\'s battle courses \"ranges from solid to excellent\", with VentureBeat saying that they remedied the issue with the original Mario Kart 8\\'s battle courses. However, Electronic Gaming Monthly said that the battle mode was \"not so much a point for Deluxe that these modes are included as it is a retroactive demerit for the original Mario Kart 8\". Many critics considered Renegade Roundup to be the best of Deluxe\\'s battle modes, though GameRevolution and USgamer said it was their least favorite of the battle modes.Reception towards Deluxe\\'s single-player and online multiplayer offerings was mixed. 4Players said that those playing alone or online \"should think twice\" [transl.] about buying the game, calling the game\\'s single-player options \"unimaginative\" [transl.], and Nintendo World Report felt that Deluxe was lacking an important element. IGN called Deluxe\\'s online multiplayer \"as barebones as ever\", though Kotaku felt that it was \"as solid as its ever been\".The mechanical changes in Deluxe also received praise. The ability to hold two items in Deluxe was praised, with many liking how it added more strategy to Deluxe\\'s item play, as well as making gameplay more exciting. Kotaku and Eurogamer both appreciated the change, though they felt that the change wasn\\'t major. Accessibility options like Smart Steering and Auto-Acceleration were also praised. Many felt that the additions made Deluxe the most accessible Mario Kart game, and others appreciated how they helped less experienced players enjoy the game, despite making the game too easy for veteran players. However, some reviewers disliked how Smart Steering was enabled by default upon first launching the game. Other reviewers disliked the accessbility mechanics\\' implementation. Shacknews found Smart Steering \"inconsistent\", disliking how it would sometimes overcorrect, and USgamer said Auto-Acceleration doesn\\'t give them the \"precise control\" that they want.The graphics and soundtrack of the game was praised by critics. Many felt that the game\\'s graphics were \\'gorgeous\\' or \\'beautiful\\', with some saying that the graphics of Deluxe were an upgrade from the Wii U original. GamesTM praised the \"incredible\" lighting of Deluxe, saying that courses like Rainbow Road and Electrodrome stood out as \"fantastic showcases for the Nintendo universe and its creative spirit\", as well as praising the game\\'s sound design. IGN felt that the \"great art direction\" in Mario Kart 8 and Deluxe was \"a major reason\" for the game\\'s graphics being remained \"gorgeous\" throughout time, and PCMag described the game\\'s performance as \"consistently solid\", aside from the lowered framerate when playing in four-player split screen. Easy Allies called Deluxe\\'s soundtrack \"something special\", saying that its renditions of both original and returning songs were \"fantastic and downright catchy\". Eurogamer called the game\\'s soundtrack \"outrageously upbeat\", and that Deluxe\\'s \"definining moment\" was perhaps the game\\'s live band rendition of Super Mario Kart\\'s main theme.\\n\\n\\n==== Booster Course Pass ====\\n\\nUpon announcement, the Booster Course Pass received mixed reception from fans. Many fans disliked that additional content for a previous game was being prioritized over a new entry in the series, citing how it had been nearly eight years since Mario Kart 8 first released on the Wii U. The graphics of the courses in the Booster Course Pass were also a point of contention, with some saying that they fell short of the standards set by Deluxe.After release, critics were mixed—according to Metacritic, Wave 1 received \"mixed or average reviews\", and Wave 2 received \"generally favorable reviews\". Criticism focused on the graphics, which were lower in detail compared to courses from the main game. Digital Foundry attributed this to the courses being built upon their versions from Mario Kart Tour. On the other hand, many reviewers felt that the courses that originated in Tour were among the best gameplay-wise, and Ninja Hideaway in particular was praised as a highlight of Wave 1. Some courses in Wave 2 were lauded, with Nintendo Life calling Waluigi Pinball\\'s graphics \"stunning\". Another common disappointment was that many courses did not include Mario Kart 8\\'s signature anti-gravity or underwater features. GameSpot lamented how the Booster Course Pass only introduced new courses, rather than new characters or customization parts. Nintendo Life praised the audio design, calling it \"stellar\" and \"a delight\", and Destructoid called Sydney Sprint\\'s soundtrack \"the best\" music of the Booster Course Pass. The addition of courses that vary every lap was praised by critics, with Nintendo Life wishing it would become a \"mainstay\" feature of the series.\\n\\n\\n=== Fan response ===\\nSeveral mods have been created for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. In February 2022, a mod was created that added Kirby\\'s Mouthful Mode car transformation (colloquially known as \"Carby\") from Kirby and the Forgotten Land as a selectable kart and character. In June 2022, a mod was published that added Green Hill Zone from the Sonic the Hedgehog series as a course.\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe has been nominated for multiple awards. The game was nominated for \"Best Switch Game\" and \"Best Remake/Remaster\" in IGN\\'s Best of 2017 Awards. Destructoid nominated the game for its \"Best Switch Game\" in their Game of the Year Awards in 2017, and the game was awarded \"Old Game of the Year\" at Giant Bomb\\'s 2017 Game of the Year Awards.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Super Mario Wiki'"

many were disappointed that the cars were stationary in the booster course pass to begin with. wave 3 of the booster course pass is set to release on december 7, 2022, containing the rock cup and the moon cup. reception critical reception mario kart 8 deluxe received \"universal acclaim\" according to the review aggregate website metacritic. many reviewers considered it to be the definitive version of mario kart 8, as well as one of the best games in the mario kart series or one of the best racing games of all time. some reviewers also consiered the game to be an essential purchase for nintendo switch owners. however, many reviewers criticized the lack of new content in deluxe compared to mario kart 8.the core racing mode present in mario kart 8 deluxe was heavily praised. the rubber-banding mechanics present in the game\\'s ai competitors was criticized, though game informer noted that \"fans accepted that pitfall as a series mainstay long ago\", and that deluxe is still \"the same great title from the wii u\". gamespot and nintendo life also considered deluxe\\'s core gameplay to be as strong as the original. gamestm\\'s reviewer appreciated the return of previous dlc, though they disliked the return of the mercedes-benz crossover items, saying that their \"blatant and commercial nature\" felt \"at odds\" with the nature of mario kart.deluxe\\'s revamped battle mode received wide acclaim. easy allies and kotaku claimed that the new battle mode far outshined the original game, and pocket gamer said that deluxe returned battle mode to its \"original arena-battling glory\". gamesradar+ found that the quality present in deluxe\\'s battle courses \"ranges from solid to excellent\", with venturebeat saying that they remedied the issue with the original mario kart 8\\'s battle courses. however, electronic gaming monthly said that the battle mode was \"not so much a point for deluxe that these modes are included as it is a retroactive demerit for the original mario kart 8\". many critics considered renegade roundup to be the best of deluxe\\'s battle modes, though gamerevolution and usgamer said it was their least favorite of the battle modes.reception towards deluxe\\'s single-player and online multiplayer offerings was mixed. 4players said that those playing alone or online \"should think twice\" about buying the game, calling the game\\'s single-player options \"unimaginative\" , and nintendo world report felt that deluxe was lacking an important element. ign called deluxe\\'s online multiplayer \"as barebones as ever\", though kotaku felt that it was \"as solid as its ever been\".the mechanical changes in deluxe also received praise. the ability to hold two items in deluxe was praised, with many liking how it added more strategy to deluxe\\'s item play, as well as making gameplay more exciting. kotaku and eurogamer both appreciated the change, though they felt that the change wasn\\'t major. accessibility options like smart steering and auto-acceleration were also praised. many felt that the additions made deluxe the most accessible mario kart game, and others appreciated how they helped less experienced players enjoy the game, despite making the game too easy for veteran players. however, some reviewers disliked how smart steering was enabled by default upon first launching the game. other reviewers disliked the accessbility mechanics\\' implementation. shacknews found smart steering \"inconsistent\", disliking how it would sometimes overcorrect, and usgamer said auto-acceleration doesn\\'t give them the \"precise control\" that they want.the graphics and soundtrack of the game was praised by critics. many felt that the game\\'s graphics were \\'gorgeous\\' or \\'beautiful\\', with some saying that the graphics of deluxe were an upgrade from the wii u original. gamestm praised the \"incredible\" lighting of deluxe, saying that courses like rainbow road and electrodrome stood out as \"fantastic showcases for the nintendo universe and its creative spirit\", as well as praising the game\\'s sound design. ign felt that the \"great art direction\" in mario kart 8 and deluxe was \"a major reason\" for the game\\'s graphics being remained \"gorgeous\" throughout time, and pcmag described the game\\'s performance as \"consistently solid\", aside from the lowered framerate when playing in four-player split screen. easy allies called deluxe\\'s soundtrack \"something special\", saying that its renditions of both original and returning songs were \"fantastic and downright catchy\". eurogamer called the game\\'s soundtrack \"outrageously upbeat\", and that deluxe\\'s \"definining moment\" was perhaps the game\\'s live band rendition of super mario kart\\'s main theme. booster course pass upon announcement, the booster course pass received mixed reception from fans. many fans disliked that additional content for a previous game was being prioritized over a new entry in the series, citing how it had been nearly eight years since mario kart 8 first released on the wii u. the graphics of the courses in the booster course pass were also a point of contention, with some saying that they fell short of the standards set by deluxe.after release, critics were mixed—according to metacritic, wave 1 received \"mixed or average reviews\", and wave 2 received \"generally favorable reviews\". criticism focused on the graphics, which were lower in detail compared to courses from the main game. digital foundry attributed this to the courses being built upon their versions from mario kart tour. on the other hand, many reviewers felt that the courses that originated in tour were among the best gameplay-wise, and ninja hideaway in particular was praised as a highlight of wave 1. some courses in wave 2 were lauded, with nintendo life calling waluigi pinball\\'s graphics \"stunning\". another common disappointment was that many courses did not include mario kart 8\\'s signature anti-gravity or underwater features. gamespot lamented how the booster course pass only introduced new courses, rather than new characters or customization parts. nintendo life praised the audio design, calling it \"stellar\" and \"a delight\", and destructoid called sydney sprint\\'s soundtrack \"the best\" music of the booster course pass. the addition of courses that vary every lap was praised by critics, with nintendo life wishing it would become a \"mainstay\" feature of the series. fan response several mods have been created for mario kart 8 deluxe. in february 2022, a mod was created that added kirby\\'s mouthful mode car transformation from kirby and the forgotten land as a selectable kart and character. in june 2022, a mod was published that added green hill zone from the sonic the hedgehog series as a course. accolades mario kart 8 deluxe has been nominated for multiple awards. the game was nominated for \"best switch game\" and \"best remake/remaster\" in ign\\'s best of 2017 awards. destructoid nominated the game for its \"best switch game\" in their game of the year awards in 2017, and the game was awarded \"old game of the year\" at giant bomb\\'s 2017 game of the year awards. notes references external links official websitemario kart 8 deluxe on the super mario wiki'"
